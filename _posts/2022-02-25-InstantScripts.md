InstantScripts: Aussie online prescription, doctor service makes $11m
=====================================================================

Kara Byers

Anyone with even half an eye on their budget knows that the key to saving money is shopping around. 

But did you know that in Australia, bargain hunting can even extend to prescriptions? 

Although Australia is ranked as the 11th most affordable place to buy common prescription drugs in the world, prices can be vastly different, with some people paying upwards of $10 more for a repeat prescription just because they switched pharmacies. 

Healthcare gaps like this, and making access to health care easy for all Australians regardless of location, were the driving force behind Dr Asher Freilich creating online prescription provider [InstantScripts](https://www.instantscripts.com.au/). 

Dr Freilich, who quit his successful career in investment banker to study medicine and become a doctor, says the first spark of the idea for InstantScripts was ignited while he was working in Healthcare Mergers and Acquisitions. 

"I've always had an interest in how medical and healthcare solutions could be delivered to the public more efficiently and in a more cost-effective way," he says. 

But it was when he was working as a junior doctor and subsequently a GP, that he realised there was an urgent need for something to make healthcare more affordable for all Australians. 

"I noticed healthcare gaps and blind spots in our current healthcare system, which often leave vulnerable Australians excluded and unable to receive quality care," he explains. 

"We are becoming increasingly time poor, and I identified a strong need for short, focused healthcare interactions. For example, there are many who need to access prescription medications but cannot access their GP. I wanted to provide Australians with efficient, affordable and above all, accessible, healthcare."

**Disrupting medicine prices**

InstantScripts, which recently received over $10 million in funding, currently fulfils around 350,000 prescriptions a year nationwide. 

The online platform works by patients picking medication from categories including anti hypertensives, blood thinners and cholesterol on the Instant Scripts app, then answering a short questionnaire.

The results are sent to a GP to review and, if successful, a prescription is emailed to a pharmacy of the patient's choosing at a cost of $15. An original script is mailed out later.

Dr Freilich started InstantScripts with his own funds and, he says, "really bootstrapped the business".

"It has certainly been a labour of love and it was tough but satisfying to fund the business on my own at the beginning," he says. 

"We recently received nearly $11 million in funding from a consortium of investors, which will allow us to expand and grow our offering."

The platform, which has a predominantly female customer base and most commonly dispenses contraceptives, antidepressants (SSRIs) and Viagra, was met with resistance from the medical community when it first launched, but that's changing, says Dr Freilich. 

"I think across many industries, disrupters are often met with scepticism and weariness, and we were certainly met with this by the community," he explains. 

"However, over time GPs and healthcare professionals have come to realise that we aren't there to replace the valuable, hands-on service that the community offers. If anything, our service often reminds patients and customers to visit their GP more regularly."

**Prescription prices in Australia **

Under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), the Federal Government subsidises the cost of medicine in Australia, so that patients pay no more than $40.30. 

Even so, the prices for medicine can vary widely under this cap depending on where you live and what pharmacy you go to.

If you purchase a [high-level extras cover from an Australian private health fund](https://www.news.com.au/best-of/money/extrashealthinsurance/news-story/5d13a2be690e0485fe3da32b01ca167b), your policy will most likely include some cover for the cost of prescription medication. Extras policies typically only provide cover for prescription drugs that are not subsidised under the PBS.

Dr Freilich says "many factors' impact prescription pricing and points out that smaller pharmacies might not have the means to discount medicines in the same way as larger chains.

And when asked about how InstantScripts manages to keep its prescriptions to $15 -- a cost he describes as "very effective and competitive" -- he says it's because of its relationships with pharmacies across the country. 

"Rather than compete with pharmacies, we partner with them instead," he explains. 

"We have partnered with more than 3500 pharmacies across the country, which accounts for over half the pharmacies in Australia. However, we would love to see standardised pricing across the board."
